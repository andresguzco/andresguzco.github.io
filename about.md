<p>I study the intersection of decision theory and computational methods. My main research interests are centered around energy-based methods, such as deep Boltzmann machines, in conjunction with Markov Decision Processes for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning frameworks. I also deeply enjoy their applications in economic, environmental, genetic, and sport settings.</p>
