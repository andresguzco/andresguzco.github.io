<p>I'm fascinated with the interplay between geometric deep learning, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. I want to explore their theoretical underpinnings, as they promise to revolutionise our understanding and capabilities. This exploration extends to a wide range of applications, from economic and environmental challenges to genetic research and sports analytics. </p>
