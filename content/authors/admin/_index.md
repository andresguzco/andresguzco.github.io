I'm a rational skeptic studying how economics, mathematics and computer science 
help us understand and model human behaviour. My research interest is twofold, its core concerns the statistical theory 
for time-series, with emphasis on causal inference, and its connection with non-parametric methods and predictive 
algorithms. Secondly, I deeply enjoy the application of these methods in economic, environmental, genetic, and sport settings.
