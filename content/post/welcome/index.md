## Overview
---
Welcome to my personal website, it is intended as a dynamic curriculum where I showcase my work. I'm developing a research career in Statistics with focus on its intersection with computer science and other fields.

As a quick glance at the experience section in the home page would show you that my background is not the most common one for someone with my aspirations. I first went into Medical School before finding my true calling, then moving 9000km away from my family study a BSc in what I found to be the best approximation to this calling. Before medical school, I found myself trying to figure out how the human body functions, with special emphasis on the brain. Why the brain? Well, my biggest question lied into human behaviour. After having taken Neuroanatomy, Neurophysiology, Medical Psychology, Neurology and a long list of other courses, I realised that my curiosity was mainly driven not at the biological understanding of the way the brain works but rather the structural way that we process information and how it's transformed. This was not the only factor as my curiosity has never been singular. I was always an overly curious kid with a knack for number and technology. I was always convinced that I would become a physicist (my second option for Major if I hadn't gone into Medical School) or mathematician (in a town with no Math major in its university), however this changed during high school when the aforementioned curiosity overtook the others. This is an overly simplistic explanation of the strange path you saw in my background.

Fast-forward to my freshman year in Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I found the reconciliation of my love for mathematics and my curiosity for modelling human behaviour and optimal decision-making. However, my degree was less than satisfactory in fulfilling my math needs, so I started following the core curriculum of Econometrics. While back home (Mexico) Econometrics exists as an esoteric course that fails a large percent of student in business and economic majors, in The Netherlands it is a full-fledged discipline in which student get trained as mathematicians to later be shown the application in Economics. The first year of that programme involved Real Analysis, Differential Equations, rigorous Probability, Linear Algebra, Mathematical Statistics and a couple of introductory economics courses; on the other hand, I only had Linear Algebra and Calculus with the rest being Economics courses, with some very unnecessary filler courses in Business. You see, the educational system in Europe is quite different from the American, the whole curriculum tends to be set in stone with no space to take electives but until rather late. This meant that I could not tailor my programme to my more rigorous tase, so I ended up joining two full-time studies to fulfil this intellectual need, although I had to de-phase the timeline of the Econometrics studies to fit all of the courses in a feasible manner. This was very rewarding but yet exhausting as I was also enrolled in the Honours Programme of my faculty, and I had to work a part-time job to make ends meet financially.

Now, I am on my way to the third year excited to be taking only pure math, stats and econometric courses such as Measure Theory, Time-series analysis, Bayesian Econometrics, Topology and Dynamical Systems. The year I'm finishing with an Honours thesis where I research statistical methods to forecast and backcast the movement of pollution particles through space and time. Meanwhile, I hope this blog helps as an annotated, simplified version of what I am doing and that it sparks your interest in Statistics and Math just as I needed back in Medical School. After this year, I will be pursuing Doctoral programmes in Statistics and Machine Learning, aspiring to have a research career that touches upon all my different intellectual pursuit.

Andr√©s.
